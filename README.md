# AniForum

AniForum is a social app created to combat the stigma against anime and provide a welcoming space for anime fans to connect, share, and discuss their favorite shows, characters, and topics. As times change and anime becomes increasingly popular and accepted worldwide, this app aims to foster open conversations and help people form meaningful communities around their shared interests.

## Motivation

Despite the growing popularity of anime, there is still a lingering stigma and misunderstanding about the medium and its fans. AniForum was created as a personal project to challenge these stereotypes and offer a positive, inclusive environment for anime enthusiasts. By providing a dedicated platform for discussion, the app hopes to break down barriers and encourage more people to embrace their love for anime without fear of judgment.

## Purpose

- **Community Building:** Enable users to form and join communities based on their favorite genres, shows, or topics.
- **Open Conversation:** Provide a safe space for thoughtful discussions, recommendations, and sharing fan content.
- **Social Impact:** Help normalize anime fandom and promote acceptance and understanding among diverse groups of people.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** – For building a cross-platform mobile app experience
- **Expo** – To streamline development and deployment of the React Native app
- **TypeScript** – For type safety and improved code quality
- **Node.js** – (If backend is present or planned) For server-side logic and APIs
- **Jest** – For unit and integration testing
- **Other Libraries:** (e.g., navigation, state management, etc. as relevant)

## Technical Overview

AniForum is structured as a modern mobile application using React Native and Expo. The codebase is organized into logical modules for components, screens, assets, and configuration. TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure robust and maintainable code. The app is designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of new features such as real-time chat, notifications, or advanced moderation tools in the future.

- **Components:** Reusable UI elements for posts, comments, community lists, etc.
- **Screens:** Main app screens such as Home, Community, Post Details, and User Profile
- **State Management:** (e.g., React Context or Redux, if used)
- **Testing:** Jest is set up for testing core logic and components
- **Assets:** Images, icons, and other static resources are stored in the `assets/` directory
